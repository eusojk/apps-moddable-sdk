Developing Apps with the Moddable SDK

This repo contains some apps created with the [Moddable SDK](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable) for the NodeMCU ESP8266 board:

* `PlayingLEDSequences` : This app monitors the duration of buttons presses and replays those presses as a sequence of blinks on LEDs.
* `OrientationDetection` : This app detects the orientation of the ESSP8266 using the [LSM9DS1 IMU](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13284). Thanks to @[andycarle](https://github.com/andycarle) for providing the [`LSM9DS1` driver](https://gist.github.com/andycarle/f1cc6d85b777453981da9e3b5d4e8ff7).
